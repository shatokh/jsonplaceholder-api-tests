# CI Examples â€” Nightly Full Run (GitHub Actions)

  schedule:
    - cron: "0 1 * * *"   # 01:00 UTC nightly
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:

    steps:

      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: "npm"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright test --reporter="dot,html"
      - name: Upload HTML report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
